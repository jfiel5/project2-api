Trouble in Paradise Trouble in Paradise SEQUENCE A FADE IN NIGHT MED. SHOT DOOR OF A HOUSE A cheap residential district. The house has no architectural character; it is not certain where we are. Near the entrance door is a garbage can, full. A dog is nibbling at some of the garbage. We hear whistling, footsteps. A garbage man comes into the picture. He shoos the dog away. Without pause in whistling, he lifts the garbage can and, followed by camera, goes to the end of the block, which is only a few steps. Now we discover we are in Venice. In the background is a major canal and a typical bridge--romantic background. Gondolas are passing. In the foreground at the sidewalk is the garbage gondola, piled high with garbage. The man dumps his load, leaves the empty can on the sidewalk, gets in the gondola, and paddles away with the grace of a gondolier. Now, in a beautiful tenor voice which is quite a contrast to the garbage, he starts singing a passionate Italian love song. LONG SHOT A GONDOL
